Below is the revised 14-day plan to build an e-commerce application using Node.js, Angular, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. The plan has been adjusted to not use Nx, to use NodeJS as the backend framework, and to deploy only to Vercel (excluding AWS and Heroku). Each day's tasks are tailored to meet these requirements while maintaining clarity and conciseness.

Day 1: Set Up Development Environment and Initialize Project
Objective: Establish the foundation for development.
Tasks:
Install Node.js (v20.x), Angular CLI (v17.x), PostgreSQL (v16.x), MongoDB (v7.x).
Create Angular project: ng new ecommerce-frontend --routing --style=scss.
Initialize Node.js backend: mkdir ecommerce-backend && cd ecommerce-backend && npm init -y.
Install Express.js: npm install express dotenv.
Set up Git with a single repository containing /ecommerce-frontend and /ecommerce-backend.
Organize folder structure as shown above.
New Feature: Configure CORS in Express.js for frontend requests.
Outcome: Two separate projects (ecommerce-frontend, ecommerce-backend) with a modular folder structure, ready for coding.

Day 2: Design and Create Database Schema
Objective: Define the data structure.
Tasks:
Design PostgreSQL tables: users, products, orders, categories.
Set up MongoDB collections: logs, sessions, user_activity.
Use Sequelize for PostgreSQL and Mongoose for MongoDB in the Node.js backend to create schemas and seed initial data.
New Feature: Introduce MongoDB sharding for scalability.
Outcome: Initialized databases with schemas and sample data.


Day 3: Implement User Authentication and Authorization
Objective: Secure user access.
Tasks:
Set up JWT authentication in Node.js with jsonwebtoken.
Create Express.js API endpoints: /api/register, /api/login, /api/profile.
Add role-based access control (e.g., admin, customer) in Express middleware.
Implement Angular authentication with route guards and HTTP interceptors.
New Feature: Integrate OAuth 2.0 for third-party logins (e.g., Google).
Outcome: Secure authentication system with user management.

Day 4: Develop Product Catalog and Search Functionality
Objective: Build product browsing.
Tasks:
Create Express.js API endpoints: /api/products, /api/categories, /api/search.
Implement search with filters (e.g., price, category) and sorting in Sequelize.
Build Angular components for product listing and details.
Replace REST with GraphQL using apollo-server-express (backend) and Apollo Client (frontend).
New Feature: Use GraphQL for efficient querying.
Outcome: Functional product catalog with advanced search.

Day 5: Implement Shopping Cart and Checkout Process
Objective: Enable purchasing.
Tasks:
Develop Express.js cart APIs: /api/cart/add, /api/cart/update, /api/cart/remove.
Create Angular cart and checkout pages.
Store cart data in MongoDB.
New Feature: Use Redis for session/cart management.
Outcome: Complete cart and checkout flow.

Day 6: Integrate Payment Gateways and Order Processing
Objective: Enable transactions.
Tasks:
Integrate Stripe or Razorpay in Express.js.
Build order logic: update inventory, save to PostgreSQL.
Send emails with Nodemailer.
New Feature: Use webhooks for real-time updates.
Outcome: Functional payment system.

Day 7: Add User Reviews and Ratings
Objective: Enhance product feedback.
Tasks:
Create Express.js APIs: /api/reviews/submit, /api/reviews/product/:id.
Add moderation logic in Express.js.
Display reviews in Angular.
New Feature: Optional sentiment analysis with natural.
Outcome: Review and rating system.

Day 8: Implement Real-Time Notifications
Objective: Add live updates.
Tasks:
Set up Socket.IO in Express.js.
Implement notifications for orders/promotions.
Connect Angular to WebSockets.
New Feature: Explore SSE as an alternative.
Outcome: Real-time notifications.

Day 9: Set Up Serverless Functions
Objective: Optimize tasks.
Tasks:
Identify tasks (e.g., image resizing, emails).
Deploy Vercel Functions.
Integrate via API calls.
New Feature: Use Vercel’s API Gateway-like features.
Outcome: Scalable task handling.


Day 10: Containerize the Application
Objective: Ensure consistency.
Tasks:
Write Dockerfiles for Express.js backend and Angular frontend.
Use Docker Compose for local testing.
Test containerized setup.
New Feature: Prepare for Vercel Docker deployment.
Outcome: Containerized app.

Day 11: Implement CI/CD Pipeline
Objective: Automate workflow.
Tasks:
Set up Vercel CI or GitHub Actions.
Automate linting, testing, deployment.
Use environment variables.
New Feature: Use Vercel preview deployments.
Outcome: Automated workflow.

Day 12: Perform Testing and Debugging
Objective: Ensure reliability.
Tasks:
Write Jest tests for Express.js APIs.
Create Cypress E2E tests for Angular.
Add Winston logging and Prometheus monitoring.
New Feature: Integrate Sentry for error tracking.
Outcome: Stable app.

Day 13: Optimize Performance and Security
Objective: Enhance speed and security.
Tasks:
Implement Redis caching.
Enforce HTTPS and secure headers in Express.js.
Optimize PostgreSQL with indexes.
New Feature: Add rate limiting/DDoS protection.
Outcome: Fast, secure app.

Day 14: Prepare for Deployment and Go Live
Objective: Launch in production.
Tasks:
Deploy to Vercel.
Configure domain, SSL, CDN (e.g., Cloudflare).
Perform final tests and launch.
New Feature: Use Vercel’s zero-downtime deployment.
Outcome: Live e-commerce platform.
